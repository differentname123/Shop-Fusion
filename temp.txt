这个文件是每一行都是一个商品描述，帮我生成相应的BIO格式数据，Use the following entity types:

Brand (brand name),
Category (product type),
Flavor (product flavor),
Specification (size, weight, volume, etc.),
Quantity (number of items),
Packaging (packaging type),
Promotion (promotional information),
Usage (intended use),
ProductionDate (production date),
Features (product features),
Unit (the unit of measurement, such as ml, g, kg, etc.).

Please follow the exact BIO format, where:

"B-<EntityType>" means the beginning of an entity.
"I-<EntityType>" means the inside of an entity.
"O" means the word is not part of any entity.
Each word should be followed by its BIO label, separated by a space. Each word-label pair should be on a new line, and the BIO tags should strictly follow the format "B-<EntityType>" or "I-<EntityType>".

给我完整的BIO数据，不要省略，BIO中不需要原始的商品描述的那行
